Event Manager
=============

The Event Manager is a ColdFusion driven event submission, subscription, and reference manager designed to be a modular solution for presentations at TCCFUG meetings. 

It accomplishes the following:

- Creates a feed or list of meeting dates, topics, presenters and resources
- Allows users to suggest or submit events
- Allows admins to "approve" submissions
- Sends notifications of approved submissions
- Records RSVPs to events
- Allows users to subscribe to the feed and be notified of submissions, approvals and/or upcoming events
